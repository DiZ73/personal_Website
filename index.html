 			Hello, my name is David Kroell. I am currently a student at
 			Christopher Newport University. While I do attend the University, I believe that it's good maintain a personalized website online where people can officially see what I'm working on, and what I'm doing.
     </br></br>
 			You can keep track of my recent updates on my Blog and on my Projects.	 All of my projects are on GitHub, and are available to view by 		everyone. I will continually update my projects and recent works on there. 
     </br></br>
 			This website is also meant for employers, to see who I am, and what I 	represent. I welcome you to the employers tab to view my resume, and any other information you'd like to see.
</br></br></br>
<u>Welcome to my site.</u>
